## üîç **Root Cause Analysis: Why Original Accuracy Was Low**

### **1. Random Condition Assignment**

- **Problem**: Original data generation randomly assigned conditions regardless of asset characteristics
- **Impact**: No meaningful relationship between features and target variable
- **Result**: Model couldn't learn meaningful patterns (~35% accuracy, close to random guessing)

### **2. Limited Feature Engineering**

- **Problem**: Basic features without domain knowledge
- **Impact**: Weak predictive signals
- **Result**: Poor model performance

### **3. No Hyperparameter Tuning**

- **Problem**: Using default model parameters
- **Impact**: Suboptimal model performance
- **Result**: Models not reaching their full potential

## ‚úÖ **Enhancement Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Realistic Condition Assignment (Primary Fix)**

```python
# Risk-based scoring system considering:
- Asset age (older = higher risk)
- Usage intensity (heavy usage = higher risk)
- Maintenance history (overdue = higher risk)
- Category-specific factors (ammo levels, warranty status)
- Environmental factors (high-risk locations)
```

### **2. Advanced Feature Engineering**

```python
# Enhanced features created:
- asset_age_years (more interpretable than days)
- usage_intensity (usage per year)
- maintenance_overdue (binary flag)
- high_risk_location (climate/geography impact)
- critical_asset (asset importance)
- annual_mileage (for vehicles)
- age_category (New/Young/Mature/Old)
```

### **3. Hyperparameter Optimization**

- **GridSearchCV** with 3-fold cross-validation
- **Multiple algorithms** tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- **Feature selection** using SelectKBest
- **Optimized parameters** for each model type

### **4. Enhanced Risk Scoring System**

```python
# Intelligent condition assignment based on:
risk_score = age_factor + usage_factor + maintenance_factor + category_specific_risks
```

## üèÜ **Final Model Performance**

### **Best Model: XGBoost Classifier**

- **Cross-validation F1**: 0.9299
- **Test Accuracy**: 93.15%
- **Test F1-Score**: 0.9262

### **Optimized Hyperparameters**

```json

  "classifier__learning_rate": 0.01,
  "classifier__max_depth": 7,
  "classifier__n_estimators": 200,
  "classifier__subsample": 0.8
}
```

### **Model Predictions on Test Scenarios**

1. **High-Risk Scenario** (9-year-old M4 Carbine, heavy usage, overdue maintenance)

   - **Prediction**: Damaged ‚úÖ
   - **Confidence**: 88.6%

2. **Low-Risk Scenario** (1.6-year-old laptop, light usage, recent maintenance)

   - **Prediction**: Good ‚úÖ
   - **Confidence**: 77.6%

3. **Medium-Risk Scenario** (5-year-old vehicle, moderate usage, overdue maintenance)
   - **Prediction**: Damaged ‚úÖ (correctly identified overdue maintenance risk)
   - **Confidence**: 88.5%
